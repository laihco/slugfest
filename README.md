## Introducing the team
Either organizing by person or by role, tell us who will do what on your team. Your team should span at least the following four roles:

Tools Lead: Ananya Setty

Engine Lead: Matt Kin

Design Lead: Melissa Rosales

Testing Lead: Melissa Rosales


## Tools and materials

Engine: We will be using three.js because it supports 3D rendering and physics and we can utilize our knowledge of typescript 

Language: Our team is planning to use TypeScript or https://threejs.org/docs/ for our game. We choose typescript because we believe we should put into practice what we have learned this quarter. 

Tools: We are planning to use VSCode as our IDE and Blender for our 3D models. One of our teammates has a little bit of experience with Blender so it makes the most sense.

Generative AI: We plan on using bayleaf AI because the formatting of the AI focuses on assisting rather than giving out answers. It is important to think first before just asking for the solution, also the step by step assistance of bayleaf is super helpful in breaking down steps and setting you up for success. 

## Outlook

Our team is hoping to add minigames that use 3d models/physics. These minigames will be different from other teams as we will be focusing on a more carnival thematic with a prize system.


As our team is centered around 2D art we will need to learn how to create 3D assets for our game. 

We want to become more comfortable using engines and tools we don’t usually use (Unity/Unreal).
